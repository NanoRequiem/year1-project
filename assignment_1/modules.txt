Methods to read in a file


validateCmdArguments(int requiredArguments, int argc)

This method is called to check the number of arguments in the command line.

initializeImage(char *fileName)

This method takes in the file name and makes sure that it is an existing file. It also dynamically
initializes the image data struct.

readFile(char *filename, image *readImage)

This method takes in the initialized image struct and then assigns the data values of the images.
Validating the data as it comes in and only allowing in data that is valid. If the data is not valid
freeData(image *readImage) is called.

freeData(image *readImage)

This method checks if any given data value is NULL and if it is not NULL it is freed before the 
program is closed.


pgmEcho methods


main(int argc, char **argv)

Main method will be used to take in arguments from the command line. The main method will then call
subsequent modules to check the program is running. The main method will call a method to take in
the file that it has read. Once the saved file has passed a different validation method it will then
finally call a module to copy the files data. 

copy(image *readImage)

Copy method will take the file that has been read in and copy it to another pgm file. It will then validate
the image it created


pgmComp methods


main(int argc, char **argv)

method takes in command line arguments and passes them to validateCmdArguments for validation. If it passes
validation it calls the read file methods on both files to compare and if they open and are saved it then calls
the Compare method.

Compare(image *firstImage, image *secondImage)

Method takes in 2 image structs and compares them to make sure they're correct and ignoring whitespace on the images.
